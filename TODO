- Improve sprite sheet loading
  * Ideally we want to be able to name sequences, (e.g. player_left, player_down, player_idle) instead of hard coding indexes into the sprite sheet

- Force the character to walk on the x-y grid (aka manhattan distances)
- Remove background from sprite sheet
- Animate the walking sequence
- Enforce window boundaries
- Main menu?
- Make character remember walking direction better
