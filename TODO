- Improve sprite sheet loading
  * Ideally we want to be able to name sequences, (e.g. player_left, player_down, player_idle) instead of hard coding indexes into the sprite sheet

- Remove background from sprite sheet
- Animate the walking sequence
- Enforce window boundaries
- Main menu?
- make characters only walk on tiles (i.e. character cannot be between two tiles)
